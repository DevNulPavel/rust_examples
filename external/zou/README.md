# zou
A simple and fast download accelerator, written in Rust

Zou is a [Snatch](https://github.com/derniercri/snatch) fork by [@k0pernicus](https://github.com/k0pernicus).
Snatch is a fast and interruptable download accelerator, written in Rust, from [@k0pernicus](https://github.com/k0pernicus) and [@Jean-Serge](https://github.com/Jean-Serge).

## Current features

* **Simple**: a command line tool to manage easily your downloads ;
* **Fast**: multithreading support ;
* **Interruptable**: _work in progress_.

**NOTE**: _Zou_ is on _alpha_ version.
This version runs well on remote contents with a length known **before** the download (with the `content-length` header from the server response).

## Goal

Let's build a better `wget` (in Rust)!

## Installation

1. Install Rust and Cargo using [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/) ;
2. You can download two versions of _Zou_ :  
  * the latest build from [crates.io](https://crates.io/): `cargo install zou` ;
  * the last commit version from Github: `cargo install --git https://github.com/k0pernicus/zou.git --branch devel` ;
3. Enjoy !

## FAQ

* Why this fork ?
Snatch has been developed when I was a R&D engineer at [DernierCri](https://derniercri.io) - it was a "just-for-fun" project.
Today, I do not work anymore in/with this startup, and I want to experiment something different.  
`Zou` is now a fun way to hack with Rust! :-)

* Libraries cannot be build
Please go check if you are using the latest version of `rustc` (stable), running `rustup update`.

* `fatal error: 'openssl/hmac.h' file not found`
If you are on a GNU/Linux distribution (like Ubuntu), please install `libssl-dev`.
If you are on macOS, please install `openssl` and check your OpenSSL configuration:

```
brew install openssl
export OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=`brew --prefix openssl`/include
export OPENSSL_LIB_DIR=`brew --prefix openssl`/lib
export DEP_OPENSSL_INCLUDE=`brew --prefix openssl`/include
```
