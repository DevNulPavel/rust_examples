.TH sk-tmux 1 "Oct 2018" "sk 0.17.5" "sk-tmux - open sk in tmux split pane"

.SH NAME
sk-tmux - open sk in tmux split pane

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sk-tmux [-u|-d [HEIGHT[%]]] [-l|-r [WIDTH[%]]] [--] [sk OPTIONS]

.SH DESCRIPTION
sk-tmux is a wrapper script for sk that opens sk in a tmux split pane. It is
designed to work just like sk except that it does not take up the whole
screen. You can safely use sk-tmux instead of sk in your scripts as the extra
options will be silently ignored if you're not on tmux.
