# Docker containers for easy dependency bundling

To facilitate downloading, building and running the required
development tools, some of the tutorials in this repository use a
container software called docker. While docker specifics are
outside of this tutorial's scope it is worth mentioning that
human readable docker configuration files named "Dockerfile"
exist in the sub-directories of this folder.

These files may be of interest to those who want details about
what will happen when docker is invoked.
