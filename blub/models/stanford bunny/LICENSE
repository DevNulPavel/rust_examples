Greg Turk and Marc Levoy created this model from multiple range scans of a real object using a Cyberware 3030 MS scanner. Morgan McGuire converted the file to OBJ, fixed holes, computed smooth vertex normals, and created a texture parameterization in 3DS Max. https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/bunny/bunny.html
