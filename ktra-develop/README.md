*Your Little Cargo Registry*.  

`Ktra` is an implementation of the [Alternate Registry](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/registries.html) that is introduced for non-public crates in Rust/Cargo 1.34.

In other words, `Ktra` is an all-in-one package for the private cargo registry.

## Documentations

- [The Ktra Book](https://book.ktra.dev)
    - includes introduction and quick start guide.

## Docker images

```
docker pull ghcr.io/moriturus/ktra:latest
```

All of the docker images are stored at [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/packages/getting-started-with-github-container-registry/about-github-container-registry).  
These are public images so you can pull them without any authentication.


Any commit on `develop` branch builds images listed below:

- `latest`
    - `db-sled` featured image.
- `openid-latest`
    - `db-sled` featured image.
    - `openid` support for authentication
- `db-redis-latest`
    - `db-redis` featured image.

- `db-mongo-latest`
    - `db-mongo` featured image.
- `db-mongo-openid-latest`
    - `db-mongo` featured image.
    - `openid` support for authentication


Similarly, images below are built automatically when tags are pushed:

- `{VERSION}` *(e.g. `0.4.3`)*
    - `db-sled` featured image.
- `openid-{VERSION}`
    - `db-sled` featured image.
    - `openid` support for authentication
- `db-redis-{VERSION}`
    - `db-redis` featured image.
- `db-redis-openid-{VERSION}`
    - `db-redis` featured image.
    - `openid` support for authentication
