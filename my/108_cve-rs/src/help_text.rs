cve-rs: Blazingly fast memory vulnerabilities, written in 100% safe rust.

This is a demo of the bugs implemented by cve-rs.

cve-rs exploits a soundness hole in lifetimes that lets us cast any lifetime to 'static, allowing us to create dangling references.
See: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25860
